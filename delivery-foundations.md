- Agile and XP
- Systems Thinking
- Knowledge Work

Using:

- Math and Statistics
- Psychology
- Sociology
- Behavioral Economics
- Evolutionary Biology
- Complexity Theory
- Scientific Method

Pragmatic Philosophy - clarifying the contents of hypothesis by tracing their practical consquences

How do you know something works well? Efficacy justifies practice

Realizing that context switching increases effort results in lower quality and increases lost time energy

We value interaction of process and tools but we also understand the reality that there is a balance. 
Without any standardization or process the cognitive load will increase and less work will be done. 
If we can't say what we do today and measure it. We cannot improve it. 
If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, then you don't know what you are doing.

> See: Team Topologies to learn ways to reduce cognitive load and why team APIs (even simple ones) are important and easy to make and improve.

**Lean**

- See the whole. Make work and process visible.
- Eliminate waste
- Experiment and learn quickly (smaller cycles)
- Decide as late as possible. At the most responsible moment.
- Deliver as fast as possible
- Empower and disintermediate
- Build integrity into the process (quality)
- Think long term

**Continuous Learning and Improvement**

What are things that cause the customers to be dissatisfied?

What are the things that cause the team to be dissatisfied?

What are things that cause partners and stakeholders to be dissatisfied?

What things are within our reach to change?

When you make a change review it in your next iteration cycle? How did it go? what can you learn?
